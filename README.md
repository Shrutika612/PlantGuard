Leaf disease detection using machine learning is a revolutionary approach in agriculture that helps identify plant infections early, ensuring better crop health and yield. By leveraging image processing, deep learning, and classification algorithms, ML models analyze leaf patterns, colors, and textures to detect diseases with high accuracy. Traditional manual inspection is time-consuming and prone to errors, whereas ML-based detection automates the process, providing faster and more reliable results. This technology assists farmers in making timely decisions, reducing pesticide overuse, and improving agricultural sustainability. With advancements in AI and computer vision, machine learning is transforming plant disease diagnosis for precision farming.
